# hw4_code_quiz

For the fourth bootcamp homework assignment I started from the ground up using a combination of Javascript, html, and CSS to create a responsive and timed quiz.

Scoring for this quiz is based on your time of completion, but time will also be subtracted for incorrect answers. To start the quiz simply click the start button and respond to multiple choice questions accordingly. Time should display in the corner of the screen on all pages.
