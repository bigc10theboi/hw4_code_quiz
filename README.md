# hw4_code_quiz

User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

For the fourth bootcamp homework assignment I started from the ground up using a combination of Javascript, html, and CSS to create a responsive and timed quiz.

Scoring for this quiz is based on your time of completion. To start the quiz simply click the start button and respond to multiple choice questions accordingly. Time should display in the corner of the screen on all pages and decrement(10) upon worng answers. There is also text which will show and stay on screen before dissappearing indicating whther or not you correctly answered a question.
